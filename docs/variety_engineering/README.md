# VSM Variety Engineering Design

## Overview

Variety Engineering implements Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety for the VSM hierarchy by managing information flows between systems to ensure each level maintains appropriate variety to handle its environment effectively.

## Current Message Flow Architecture

### Communication Channels
1. **Phoenix PubSub** - Internal coordination between VSM systems
2. **AMQP (RabbitMQ)** - External integration and algedonic signaling
3. **GenServer calls/casts** - Direct system-to-system communication

### System Message Patterns
- **S5 (Queen)**: Policy broadcasts, viability metrics, algedonic signals
- **S4 (Intelligence)**: Environmental insights, adaptation proposals, anomaly alerts
- **S3 (Control)**: Resource allocations, performance metrics, audit results
- **S2 (Coordinator)**: Anti-oscillation dampening, message routing, synchronization
- **S1 (Operations)**: Operational events, work results, sensor data

## Variety Attenuation Design (Upward Flow)

### S1 → S2: Event Aggregation Filter
**Purpose**: Reduce operational noise while preserving essential patterns
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Filters.S1ToS2 do
  # Aggregates multiple S1 events into coordination patterns
  # Filters out: routine operations, normal fluctuations
  # Preserves: anomalies, coordination needs, resource conflicts
end
```

### S2 → S3: Pattern to Resource Filter  
**Purpose**: Convert coordination patterns into resource management signals
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Filters.S2ToS3 do
  # Transforms coordination patterns into resource allocation needs
  # Filters out: transient patterns, self-resolving conflicts
  # Preserves: persistent bottlenecks, resource constraints
end
```

### S3 → S4: Metrics to Trends Filter
**Purpose**: Extract strategic insights from operational metrics
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Filters.S3ToS4 do
  # Aggregates resource metrics into environmental trends
  # Filters out: normal variations, expected cycles
  # Preserves: emerging patterns, anomalies, opportunities
end
```

### S4 → S5: Insights to Policy Filter
**Purpose**: Synthesize policy-relevant information from intelligence
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Filters.S4ToS5 do
  # Converts environmental insights to policy decisions
  # Filters out: tactical details, implementation specifics
  # Preserves: strategic threats, viability risks, identity challenges
end
```

## Variety Amplification Design (Downward Flow)

### S5 → S4: Policy Amplification
**Purpose**: Expand policies into environmental scanning directives
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Amplifiers.S5ToS4 do
  # Translates high-level policies into specific scanning priorities
  # Amplifies: strategic goals → environmental monitoring targets
  # Generates: adaptation constraints, innovation boundaries
end
```

### S4 → S3: Adaptation Amplification
**Purpose**: Convert adaptation proposals into resource allocation plans
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Amplifiers.S4ToS3 do
  # Expands adaptation strategies into resource requirements
  # Amplifies: strategic changes → tactical resource plans
  # Generates: allocation priorities, optimization targets
end
```

### S3 → S2: Resource Amplification
**Purpose**: Transform resource decisions into coordination rules
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Amplifiers.S3ToS2 do
  # Converts resource allocations into coordination protocols
  # Amplifies: resource constraints → operational rules
  # Generates: synchronization requirements, flow limits
end
```

### S2 → S1: Coordination Amplification
**Purpose**: Expand coordination rules into specific operational tasks
```elixir
defmodule VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Amplifiers.S2ToS1 do
  # Translates coordination protocols into executable operations
  # Amplifies: abstract rules → concrete tasks
  # Generates: work assignments, sensor configurations
end
```

### Message Interceptor Pattern
All variety engineering will use a message interceptor pattern:
1. Subscribe to relevant PubSub topics and AMQP exchanges
2. Apply filtering/amplification logic
3. Forward processed messages to appropriate destinations
4. Track variety metrics for monitoring

### Configuration
Variety thresholds and rules will be configurable:
```elixir
config :vsm_phoenix, :variety_engineering,
  s1_aggregation_window: 5_000,      # 5 second aggregation
  s2_pattern_threshold: 0.7,         # Pattern significance
  s3_trend_window: 60_000,           # 1 minute trends
  s4_policy_relevance: 0.8,          # Policy impact threshold
  amplification_factor: 3            # Default amplification ratio
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Variety Metrics
- **Input Variety**: Messages received per second at each level
- **Output Variety**: Messages sent per second from each level
- **Variety Ratio**: Output/Input variety (should approach 1.0)
- **Processing Delay**: Time to filter/amplify messages
- **Information Loss**: Percentage of filtered information

### Dashboard Integration
The variety engineering metrics will integrate with the existing VSM dashboard to provide real-time visibility into information flow balance.

## Next Steps

1. Implement base variety engineering supervisor
2. Create filter modules for each system boundary
3. Implement amplifier modules for downward flow
4. Add variety metrics collection
5. Integrate with existing message flows
6. Create dashboard visualizations
7. Add configuration and tuning capabilities
