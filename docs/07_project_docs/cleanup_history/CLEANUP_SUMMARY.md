- Disorganized test scripts

### After
- Clean root with only essential files
- All logs moved to `/logs` directory

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` created

## Phase 2: Project-Wide Organization (Completed)

### lib/vsm_phoenix/mcp/ Directory
**Before:** 44 mixed files (docs, tests, source code)
**After:** 
- Documentation moved to `/docs/mcp/`
- Tests moved to `lib/vsm_phoenix/mcp/test/`
- Only source code remains in main directory

### scripts/ Directory
**Before:** 
- Scattered test scripts
- Empty directories
- Duplicate validation scripts
- Mixed demos and tests

**After:**
- `/scripts/demos/` - Pure demo scripts (3 files)
- `/scripts/tests/` - All test and validation scripts
- `/scripts/tools/` - Utility scripts
- `/scripts/test_runners/` - Test execution scripts
- Removed empty directories

### Documentation
**Before:** Scattered across multiple directories
**After:** 
- All docs consolidated in `/docs/`
- MCP docs in `/docs/mcp/`
- Test documentation in `/docs/testing/`

## Files Removed
- `erl_crash.dump` (5.3MB)
- `inspect` (temporary file)
- Empty directories: `scripts/test`, `scripts/validation`, `scripts/mcp_tests`

## Test Results
- All tests still pass with same results (167 tests, 18 failures)
- Coverage remains at 0.90%
- MCP server starts successfully
- No functionality broken
