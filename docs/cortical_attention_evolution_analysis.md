}
```

### Key Intelligence Multipliers

## Phase 4 GEPA Intelligence Integration

### Evolutionary Attention Optimization

**Phase 4 transforms attention from reactive to proactive**:

1. **Prompt Evolution for Attention Scoring**
   ```elixir
   # Current: Fixed attention scoring algorithm
   calculate_attention(message, context) ->
     base_score * state_multiplier * fatigue_factor

   # GEPA Enhanced: Evolved scoring prompts
   evolve_attention_strategy(message, context, performance_history) ->
     optimized_prompt_strategy * evolved_weights * success_feedback
   ```

2. **Self-Optimizing Environmental Scan Integration**

**Revolutionary Enhancement**: Attention becomes semantically aware

1. **Contextual Fusion with Attention**
   ```elixir
   # Current: Syntax-based attention scoring
   attention_score = calculate_dimensions(message)

   # Phase 5: Semantic attention through meaning graphs
   semantic_attention = meaning_graph.semantic_relevance(message, context) 
                      * causal_graph.causal_importance(message)
                      * distributed_consensus.attention_weight(message)
   ```

2. **Distributed Attention Consensus**
   - Multiple VSM instances vote on message importance
   - Meaning graphs shared across distributed cognition network
   - Collective intelligence influences individual attention decisions

3. **Causal Graph Attention Weighting**
   - Messages weighted by their position in causal event graphs

2. **Network Intelligence**: Collective attention patterns exceed individual capability
3. **Predictive Optimization**: Environmental awareness enables proactive attention allocation
4. **Semantic Understanding**: Meaning-aware attention transcends syntactic pattern matching

This roadmap transforms VSM Phoenix from a reactive coordination system into a proactive, intelligent, and collectively-aware cognitive architecture that can anticipate, adapt, and optimize its attention strategies in real-time.
