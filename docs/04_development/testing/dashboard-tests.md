# Dashboard Test Results

## Current Dashboard Behavior ✅

The dashboard is **working correctly** and responding to algedonic signals in real-time!

### Test Sequence

1. **Initial State**: 89.1% viability
2. **After Pleasure Signal (0.95 intensity)**: 98.6% viability ⬆️
3. **After Pain Signal (0.8 intensity)**: 86.6% viability ⬇️

### What's Happening

The dashboard is:
- ✅ Receiving PubSub broadcasts when signals are sent
- ✅ Updating the viability score in real-time
- ✅ Reflecting changes immediately in the UI
- ✅ Persisting values between page refreshes (until signals change them)

### How It Works

1. **API Call** → Pain/Pleasure signal sent to `/api/vsm/algedonic/:signal`
2. **Queen Processing** → Updates internal viability metrics
3. **PubSub Broadcast** → Sends `{:viability_update, metrics}` to "vsm:health" channel
4. **LiveView Update** → Dashboard receives broadcast and updates viability_score
5. **UI Refresh** → Phoenix LiveView automatically updates the DOM

### Dashboard Features

The dashboard also shows:
- System 5 (Queen): Policy Coherence, Identity Preservation, Strategic Alignment
- System 4 (Intelligence): Environmental Scan, Adaptation Readiness, Innovation Index
- System 3 (Control): Resource Efficiency, Utilization, Active Allocations
- System 2 (Coordinator): Coordination Effectiveness, Message Flows, Synchronization
- System 1 (Operations): Success Rate, Orders Processed, Customer Satisfaction

All systems are interconnected and the viability score represents the overall health of the entire VSM hierarchy.
