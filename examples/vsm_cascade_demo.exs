    🎯 VSM CASCADE DEMONSTRATION - BEST PRACTICE
    ==========================================
    
    Scenario: Major Customer Complaint Triggers System-Wide Response
    
    This will show:
    1. How information flows UP the hierarchy (1→2→3→4→5)
    2. How decisions flow DOWN the hierarchy (5→4→3→2→1)
    3. Real data changes at each level
    4. Observable outputs from each system
