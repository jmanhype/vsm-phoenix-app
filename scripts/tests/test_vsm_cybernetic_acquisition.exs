    🐝 VSM CYBERNETIC VARIETY ACQUISITION DEMONSTRATION
    ===================================================
    
    This demonstrates VSM's ability to:
    1. Detect variety gaps (insufficient capabilities)
    2. Discover external MCP servers via MAGG
    3. Evaluate and select appropriate servers
    4. Autonomously integrate new capabilities
    5. Expand operational variety to match environmental demands

    VSM has successfully:
    ✅ Detected variety insufficiency (Ashby's Law)
    ✅ Discovered external capabilities via MAGG
    ✅ Evaluated options using cybernetic principles
    ✅ Made autonomous acquisition decisions
    ✅ Integrated new MCP servers seamlessly
    ✅ Expanded variety to exceed environmental demands
    ✅ Learned from the experience for future adaptation
    
    The system now has requisite variety to handle file and git operations!
