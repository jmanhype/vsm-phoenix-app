# System 4 Intelligence Directory

This directory contains advanced intelligence components for environmental analysis.

## Files in this directory:
- `scanner.ex` - Environmental scanning for threats/opportunities
- `analyzer.ex` - Deep analysis of environmental signals
- `adaptation_engine.ex` - Generates adaptation proposals

## Components:

### Scanner
Continuously monitors:
- External data sources
- System boundaries
- Environmental changes
- Emerging patterns

### Analyzer
Processes scanner data:
- Pattern recognition
- Trend analysis
- Risk assessment
- Opportunity scoring

### Adaptation Engine
Creates responses:
- Generates adaptation proposals
- Evaluates feasibility
- Prioritizes by impact
- Tracks implementation

## Integration:
- Uses telemetry signals for pattern detection
- Leverages LLM for creative solutions
- Coordinates with System 3 for resources
- Reports critical findings to System 5
