# System 3 Directory

This directory contains System 3 (Control) implementation for resource management and optimization.

## Files in this directory:
- `control.ex` - Main control logic for resource allocation
- `audit_channel.ex` - System 3* (Three Star) audit capabilities

## Purpose:

System 3 manages resources across all System 1 units, ensuring optimal allocation and preventing conflicts. It includes:

### Control Functions:
- Resource allocation decisions
- Optimization algorithms
- Conflict resolution
- Performance monitoring

### Audit Channel (3*):
- Direct inspection of System 1 units
- Bypass normal reporting channels
- Verify actual vs reported state
- Emergency intervention capability

## Key Integration:
- Receives variety metrics from System 1
- Coordinates with System 2 for anti-oscillation
- Reports to System 4 for strategic alignment
- Can trigger algedonic signals to System 5
