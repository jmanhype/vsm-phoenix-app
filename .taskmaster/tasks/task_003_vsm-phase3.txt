# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Variety Engineering with Attenuation and Amplification Between VSM Levels
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop mechanisms for variety engineering that implement proper attenuation and amplification between different VSM levels in accordance with Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the existing variety engineering mechanisms to better manage complexity between VSM levels:

1. Enhance the existing `VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.Supervisor` and its components:
   - Build upon the existing filters (S1ToS2, S2ToS3, etc.) and amplifiers
   - Add adaptive filtering capabilities to existing modules
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing implementations

2. Create a new `VsmPhoenix.VarietyEngineering.AdaptiveManager` GenServer that will:
   - Coordinate with the existing VarietyCalculator and BalanceMonitor
   - Implement dynamic adjustment of attenuation and amplification parameters
   - Monitor system state to automatically optimize variety engineering
   - Provide APIs for manual override and configuration

3. Enhance core variety engineering components:
   - Extend the existing signal classification modules with adaptive capabilities
   - Implement learning algorithms that improve attenuation/amplification over time
   - Add contextual awareness to filtering decisions
   - Develop feedback mechanisms to evaluate filtering effectiveness

4. Integrate with existing VSM infrastructure:
   - Connect with the existing amplify_variety/2 function in RecursiveProtocol
   - Ensure proper interaction with MetaLearningManager
   - Implement monitoring hooks to measure variety levels and engineering effectiveness

5. Improve Ashby's Law compliance mechanisms:
   - Enhance existing metrics to better measure variety at each VSM level
   - Implement more sophisticated balancing algorithms to ensure requisite variety
   - Develop visualization tools for system operators to monitor variety levels

6. Extend configuration interfaces:
   - Create APIs for dynamic adjustment of attenuation/amplification parameters
   - Implement configuration persistence and versioning
   - Develop presets for common variety engineering scenarios

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test enhanced attenuation algorithms with various input complexities
   - Verify integration with existing filters (S1ToS2, S2ToS3, etc.)
   - Test the new AdaptiveManager GenServer functionality
   - Verify coordination between AdaptiveManager and VarietyCalculator/BalanceMonitor
   - Test adaptive filtering under different system conditions
   - Verify correct measurement of variety metrics
   - Test configuration persistence and loading

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test integration with existing amplify_variety/2 function in RecursiveProtocol
   - Verify proper interaction with MetaLearningManager
   - Test end-to-end message flow with enhanced variety engineering applied
   - Verify correct behavior during parent-child VSM communication

3. Performance Tests:
   - Measure processing overhead introduced by adaptive variety engineering
   - Compare performance with previous non-adaptive implementation
   - Test system behavior under high message volume
   - Verify scalability with increasing numbers of VSM levels

4. Compliance Tests:
   - Verify system maintains requisite variety under various conditions
   - Test recovery from artificially induced variety imbalances
   - Validate that variety metrics accurately reflect system state

5. Acceptance Tests:
   - Demonstrate adaptive variety engineering in action with real-world scenarios
   - Verify that higher VSM levels receive appropriately attenuated information
   - Confirm that lower VSM levels receive properly amplified instructions
   - Validate that the system remains stable under changing conditions
