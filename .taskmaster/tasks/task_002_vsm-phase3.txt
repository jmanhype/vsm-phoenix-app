# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Meta-Learning Infrastructure for Inter-VSM Pattern Sharing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a meta-learning infrastructure that enables Virtual State Machines (VSMs) to learn from each other's patterns through AMQP message passing by extending the existing VsmPhoenix.AMQP.RecursiveProtocol module.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a meta-learning system that allows VSMs to share learned patterns and insights with each other by extending the existing VsmPhoenix.AMQP.RecursiveProtocol module:

1. Extend the existing VsmPhoenix.AMQP.RecursiveProtocol module:
   - Utilize the existing initiate_meta_learning/2 function
   - Integrate with the existing publish_recursive/2 function for pattern sharing
   - Implement additional helper functions as needed for meta-learning operations

2. Create new modules for meta-learning:
   - Implement VsmPhoenix.MetaLearning.Manager as a GenServer to coordinate pattern sharing
   - Develop VsmPhoenix.MetaLearning.PatternExtractor for identifying valuable patterns
   - Use ETS tables for efficient pattern storage and retrieval
   - Implement Phoenix.PubSub for real-time pattern sharing notifications

3. Implement core meta-learning components:
   - Pattern extraction module to identify valuable patterns from VSM operations
   - Pattern validation to ensure quality of shared insights
   - Pattern integration mechanism to incorporate external patterns into a VSM's knowledge base
   - Conflict resolution for contradictory patterns from different sources

4. Add configuration options to control meta-learning behavior:
   - Enable/disable pattern sharing for specific VSMs
   - Set trust levels for different pattern sources
   - Configure pattern acceptance thresholds
   - Set up pattern sharing frequency and bandwidth limits

5. Implement security measures:
   - Authenticate pattern sources
   - Validate pattern integrity
   - Prevent malicious pattern injection
   - Implement rate limiting for pattern sharing

6. Create monitoring and analytics for the meta-learning process:
   - Track pattern sharing statistics
   - Measure pattern adoption rates
   - Evaluate pattern effectiveness
   - Generate reports on knowledge transfer between VSMs

7. Integrate with the existing RecursiveProtocol module:
   - Ensure meta-learning works with parent-child VSM relationships
   - Enable pattern inheritance from parent to child VSMs
   - Allow pattern promotion from child to parent VSMs

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test pattern extraction from VSM operational data
   - Verify pattern serialization/deserialization
   - Test integration with publish_recursive/2 function
   - Test VsmPhoenix.MetaLearning.Manager GenServer functionality
   - Test VsmPhoenix.MetaLearning.PatternExtractor operations
   - Test ETS table operations for pattern storage and retrieval
   - Test Phoenix.PubSub for pattern sharing notifications
   - Validate pattern integration mechanisms
   - Test security measures including authentication and validation
   - Verify conflict resolution logic

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up a network of test VSMs and verify pattern sharing
   - Test pattern sharing between parent and child VSMs
   - Verify integration with the existing initiate_meta_learning/2 function
   - Measure performance impact of meta-learning on VSM operations
   - Verify system behavior under high message volume
   - Test recovery from communication failures

3. Functional Tests:
   - Verify that VSMs actually improve performance after incorporating patterns
   - Test with different types of patterns (algorithmic, behavioral, resource management)
   - Validate that pattern sharing respects configured limits and thresholds
   - Test the system's ability to identify and reject invalid patterns
   - Verify real-time notifications through Phoenix.PubSub

4. Performance Tests:
   - Measure throughput of pattern sharing under various loads
   - Test scalability with increasing numbers of VSMs
   - Benchmark memory usage during pattern processing
   - Evaluate network bandwidth consumption
   - Measure ETS table performance under high load

5. Security Tests:
   - Attempt to inject malicious patterns
   - Test authentication bypass scenarios
   - Verify rate limiting effectiveness
   - Test pattern validation robustness
