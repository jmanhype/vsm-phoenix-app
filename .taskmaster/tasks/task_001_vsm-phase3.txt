# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Recursive VSM Spawning in RecursiveProtocol Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing VsmPhoenix.AMQP.RecursiveProtocol module to enhance its recursive VSM spawning capabilities using Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
# Details:
This task involves extending the existing recursive spawning mechanism in the VsmPhoenix.AMQP.RecursiveProtocol module. The implementation should:

1. Implement a proper `SpawnManager` GenServer in the RecursiveProtocol module that handles the lifecycle of child VSMs:
   - Build upon the existing `spawn_recursive_vsm/2` function
   - Implement state tracking for all spawned child VSMs
   - Add monitoring capabilities to detect and handle child VSM termination

2. Enhance the existing methods for parent VSMs to create, initialize, and manage child VSMs:
   - Extend `spawn_recursive_vsm/2` with additional configuration options
   - Add `terminate_child_vsm/1`: Gracefully terminates a specific child VSM
   - Implement `list_child_vsms/0`: Returns information about all active child VSMs

3. Enhance the existing AMQP communication infrastructure:
   - Extend the "vsm.recursive" exchange with proper routing for parent-child relationships
   - Complete the implementation of `create_mcp_client` and `start_mcp_server` stubs
   - Implement serialization/deserialization of VSM state for transmission
   - Establish proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

4. Implement state synchronization between parent and child VSMs:
   - Define protocols for state updates and notifications
   - Create mechanisms for propagating state changes up/down the hierarchy
   - Handle potential race conditions in state updates

5. Use Elixir's DynamicSupervisor for managing child VSM processes:
   - Implement proper supervision strategies for child VSMs
   - Add resource allocation and monitoring capabilities
   - Create throttling mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion

6. Document the API thoroughly with examples of spawning patterns and best practices.

The implementation should ensure proper isolation between VSMs while maintaining efficient communication pathways. Consider performance implications of different spawning strategies and optimize accordingly.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for the SpawnManager GenServer and all its public functions
   - Test VSM spawning with various configurations using the enhanced spawn_recursive_vsm/2
   - Verify proper cleanup when child VSMs are terminated
   - Test error handling for invalid spawn requests
   - Verify proper functioning of the DynamicSupervisor implementation

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up test scenarios with multiple levels of VSM nesting (parent → child → grandchild)
   - Verify AMQP message passing through the extended "vsm.recursive" exchange
   - Test routing between different levels of the hierarchy
   - Test state synchronization between parent and child VSMs
   - Verify the enhanced create_mcp_client and start_mcp_server functions
   - Measure performance metrics for different spawning patterns

3. Stress Tests:
   - Test system behavior when spawning large numbers of child VSMs
   - Measure resource consumption and identify potential bottlenecks
   - Verify system stability under high message throughput conditions
   - Test the effectiveness of the implemented throttling mechanisms

4. Failure Recovery Tests:
   - Simulate network partitions between parent and child VSMs
   - Test recovery mechanisms when child VSMs crash unexpectedly
   - Verify parent VSM behavior when AMQP broker becomes unavailable
   - Test the DynamicSupervisor's ability to handle and recover from failures

5. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create a complete test application that demonstrates recursive VSM spawning
   - Verify that all VSM levels function correctly in a production-like environment
   - Test interoperability with existing system components

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Document any performance benchmarks and include them in the test results.
