        "title": "Implement Recursive VSM Spawning in RecursiveProtocol Module",
        "description": "Develop functionality in the RecursiveProtocol module that enables parent Virtual State Machines (VSMs) to spawn child VSMs using Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).",
        "details": "This task involves implementing a recursive spawning mechanism for Virtual State Machines within the RecursiveProtocol module. The implementation should:\n\n1. Create a new `SpawnManager` class in the RecursiveProtocol module that handles the lifecycle of child VSMs.\n2. Implement methods for parent VSMs to create, initialize, and manage child VSMs:\n   - `spawnChild(config)`: Creates a new child VSM with specified configuration\n   - `terminateChild(id)`: Gracefully terminates a specific child VSM\n   - `listChildren()`: Returns information about all active child VSMs\n\n3. Set up AMQP communication channels between parent and child VSMs:\n   - Configure message queues for parent-child communication\n   - Implement serialization/deserialization of VSM state for transmission\n   - Establish proper error handling and recovery mechanisms\n\n4. Implement state synchronization between parent and child VSMs:\n   - Define protocols for state updates and notifications\n   - Create mechanisms for propagating state changes up/down the hierarchy\n   - Handle potential race conditions in state updates\n\n5. Add resource management capabilities:\n   - Implement resource allocation strategies for child VSMs\n   - Add monitoring of child VSM resource usage\n   - Create throttling mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion\n\n6. Document the API thoroughly with examples of spawning patterns and best practices.\n\nThe implementation should ensure proper isolation between VSMs while maintaining efficient communication pathways. Consider performance implications of different spawning strategies and optimize accordingly.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Tests:\n   - Create unit tests for the SpawnManager class and all its public methods\n   - Test VSM spawning with various configurations\n   - Verify proper cleanup when child VSMs are terminated\n   - Test error handling for invalid spawn requests\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Set up test scenarios with multiple levels of VSM nesting (parent → child → grandchild)\n   - Verify AMQP message passing between different levels of the hierarchy\n   - Test state synchronization between parent and child VSMs\n   - Measure performance metrics for different spawning patterns\n\n3. Stress Tests:\n   - Test system behavior when spawning large numbers of child VSMs\n   - Measure resource consumption and identify potential bottlenecks\n   - Verify system stability under high message throughput conditions\n\n4. Failure Recovery Tests:\n   - Simulate network partitions between parent and child VSMs\n   - Test recovery mechanisms when child VSMs crash unexpectedly\n   - Verify parent VSM behavior when AMQP broker becomes unavailable\n\n5. End-to-End Tests:\n   - Create a complete test application that demonstrates recursive VSM spawning\n   - Verify that all VSM levels function correctly in a production-like environment\n   - Test interoperability with existing system components\n\nAll tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Document any performance benchmarks and include them in the test results.",
